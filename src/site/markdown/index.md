## Model and Standards-Based Process-simulation in MediciNe

In MSBPMN (Model and Standards-Based Process-simulation in MediciNe) a standards-based model
transformation between BPMN 2.0 and HL7速 FHIR速 is developed.
The goal is to define clinical guidelines and treatment plans in HL7速 FHIR速 and to automatically
generate BPMN models, which are then used in the IT systems for process control and documentation.
The implementation of the model transformation provides a reference how a transformation between the
two standards can look. It is closely coordinated with the HL7 Workflow Project. This project aims to
make a significant contribution to the digitisation (of processes) of evidence-based medicine.

## Documentation

The different concept of there transformation are explained [here](transformation.md). Whereas [here](fhir2bpmn.md) you
can find a few examples on how the transformation works, and how the results are looking.
